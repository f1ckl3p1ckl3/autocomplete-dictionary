# autocomplete-dictionary

## Overview
This is a project made for COMP20003 investigating the application of different data structures for creating a dictionary in C. dict1 represents a simple sorted array, dict2 is a linked list and dict3 uses a radix tree as the data structure. 

## How to run
Clone the repository and run the following commands in terminal
```
cd ~/[file directory the repo is in]
```
```
make -B dict[?]
```
```
./dict[?] [?] tests/dataset_1000.csv output.out < tests/test1000.in > output.stdout.out
```
(where [?] represents the number dictionary that you want to test)


#### To view results, simply see the file output in the generated files ```output.out``` or ```output.stdout.out```
